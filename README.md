## Summary
Though the changes in Oahu to vary between June and December, it is not nearly as drastic as other places in the country. Still begs the question if ice cream and surfing will be profitable in those winter months when the temperature can drop to 56F.
From looking at Jan and Feb, it shows us that Dec is not the coldest month of the year. And A temperature range that will best encourage people to surf and eat ice cream should be established to ensure that this is the best location to be successful.
